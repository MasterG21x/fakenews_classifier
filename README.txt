This repository contains a complete, end-to-end pipeline for classifying news articles as **fake** or **real** using classical machine-learning techniques in **scikit-learn**. The project is a compact, educational example that demonstrates:

* data acquisition
* data cleaning and preprocessing
* feature engineering with TF-IDF
* model selection with cross-validation
* final evaluation on test set
